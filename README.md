# Intro to R 🚀

This repository contains my learning projects and notes from my journey with **R programming**.  
I started working on these resources on **April 25** as part of building structured learning materials for myself, and now I’m sharing them publicly to help others interested in R, data visualization, and machine learning.  


## 📂 Projects

- **proj_titanic.R**  
  A classic beginner project using the Titanic dataset to practice data cleaning, exploration, and predictive modeling.

- **proj_nycflights23.R**  
  An exploration of the NYC flights dataset, focusing on data wrangling and visualization in R.


## 📘 Additional Resources

Alongside this code, I’ve been compiling detailed notes in Notion. These cover theory, examples, and step-by-step guides:

## 🛠️ Tools & Packages

- **R** (base R + tidyverse)  
- **ggplot2** for visualization  
- **dplyr** for data manipulation  


## 🌱 Next Steps

I’ll continue expanding these resources as I explore more topics in data science and machine learning.  
Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
